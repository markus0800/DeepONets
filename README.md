Porject at Tu Delft in Scientific machine learning 

The project explored sampling techniques for DeepONets.  
We studied how the number of sensors and batch sampling effect learning rate and error. 
This was done in two diffferent settings, one dimensional cosinus antiderivative and the time dependent convection diffusion equation. 

The project concluded that there are definite thresholds for the number of sample points for learning rates. 
Batch sampling signifanctly reduced training time without error loss.
